Question 5: Define Favicon and give illustrative example

Solutions: 

   A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, square icon associated with a website that appears in a browser's address bar or next to the site's name in bookmarks. Favicons serve as a visual representation of a website and contribute to brand recognition. They are typically in the ICO (Icon) file format, but other formats like PNG are also supported

 Example:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>BookWorld - Your Online Bookstore</title>
<!-- Favicon -->
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>
</body>
